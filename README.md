# CI/CD Node App

This is a sample app created for the [January 2022 FCIP meetup](https://www.meetup.com/goFCIP/events/273935663/). 

It consists of a very basic and poorly tested [Express API](https://expressjs.com/) that is fed by a [SQLite database](https://www.sqlite.org) to serve up slide content.

The content is read by a very simple and poorly tested [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) front end app.

I am an experienced developer, but a novice when it comes to Express and Vue. 

Use at your own risk.

## Nobody's Pefect

Q: What if the requred steps stall with the `Expected â€” Waiting for status to be reported` message?

A: You can push and empty commit to re-trigger the required workflows with `git commit --amend --no-edit`
